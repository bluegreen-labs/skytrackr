Description: Calculate geolocations by light using template matching. 
 The routine uses a calibration free optimization of a sky illuminance model to 
 determine locations robustly using a template matching approach,
 as described by Ekstrom (2004) <https://nipr.repo.nii.ac.jp/records/2496>,
 and behaviourly informed constraints (step-selection).
