	volume = {26},
	abstract = {The common swift (Apus apus) is adapted to an aerial lifestyle, where food and nest material are captured in the air. Observations have prompted scientists to hypothesize that swifts stay airborne for their entire non-breeding period [1, 2], including migration into sub-Saharan Africa [3–5]. It is mainly juvenile common swifts that occasionally roost in trees or buildings before autumn migration when weather is bad [1, 6]. In contrast, the North American chimney swift (Chaetura pelagica) and Vaux’s swift (C. vauxi) regularly settle to roost in places like chimneys and buildings during migration and winter [7, 8]. Observations of common swifts during the winter months are scarce, and roost sites have never been found in sub-Saharan Africa. In the breeding season, nonbreeding individuals usually spend the night airborne [9], whereas adult nesting birds roost in the nest [1]. We equipped common swifts with a micro data logger with an accelerometer to record ﬂight activity (years 1–2) and with a light-level sensor for geolocation (year 2). Our data show that swifts are airborne for {\textgreater}99\% of the time during their 10-month nonbreeding period; some individuals never settled, but occasional events of ﬂight inactivity occurred in most individuals. Apparent ﬂight activity was lower during the daytime than during the nighttime, most likely due to prolonged gliding episodes during the daytime when soaring in thermals. Our data also revealed that twilight ascents, previously observed during the summer [10], occur throughout the year. The results have important implications for understanding physiological adaptations to endure prolonged periods of ﬂight, including the need to sleep while airborne.},

This paper extends DE-MC with a snooker updater and shows by simulation and real examples that DEMC can work for d up to 50–100 with fewer parallel chains (e.g. N = 3) by exploiting information from their past by generating jumps from differences of pairs of past states. This approach extends the practical applicability of DE-MC and is shown to be about 5–26 times more efﬁcient than the optimal Normal random walk Metropolis sampler for the 97.5\% point of a variable from a 25–50 dimensional Student t3 distribution. In a nonlinear mixed effects model example the approach outperformed a block-updater geared to the speciﬁc features of the model.},

Use of geologgers on small birds has great potential to help address major research and conservation questions, but the method is not without its shortcomings. Among these shortcomings are the need to recapture birds after they have carried a device throughout a migration cycle and the potential for the devices to affect survival and behavior. We examined return rates of birds with geologgers in published and unpublished studies and found no evidence of a general negative effect of geologgers on survival, although there were a few individual studies where such an effect was evident. From these same studies, we found that most currently used harness materials are equivalent in terms of failure rates, and the most reliable geologgers are those made by the British Antarctic Survey (although these were also the largest geologgers used in the studies we examined). With regard to analysis methods, we believe there is much room for improvement. Use of online archiving of both data and analysis parameters would greatly improve the repeatability and transparency of geologger research.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of light level loggers (geolocators) to understand movements and distributions in terrestrial and marine vertebrates, particularly during the non-breeding period, has increased dramatically in recent years. However, inferring positions from light data is not straightforward, often relies on assumptions that are difficult to test, or includes an element of subjectivity.
Results: We present an intuitive framework to compute locations from twilight events collected by geolocators from different manufacturers. The procedure uses an iterative forward step selection, weighting each possible position using a set of parameters that can be specifically selected for each analysis. The approach was tested on data from two wide-ranging seabird species - black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophris and wandering albatross Diomedea exulans – tracked at Bird Island, South Georgia, during the two most contrasting periods of the year in terms of light regimes (solstice and equinox). Using additional information on travel speed, sea surface temperature and land avoidance, our approach was considerably more accurate than the traditional threshold method (errors reduced to medians of 185 km and 145 km for solstice and equinox periods, respectively).
Conclusions: The algorithm computes stable results with uncertainty estimates, including around the equinoxes, and does not require calibration of solar angles. Accuracy can be increased by assimilating information on travel speed and behaviour, as well as environmental data. This framework is available through the open source R package probGLS, and can be applied in a wide range of biologging studies.},

                    Solar geolocation is used to quantify the movements of animals tagged with sensors that record ambient light with respect to time. Global location sensor (
                    GLS
                    ) tags are small, light, and present minimal drag or wing loading. They are affordable, and some can record data for several migratory cycles. These benefits mean they can be used in applications for which satellite tags are unsuitable. However, large errors in estimated locations can result if the sensor is obscured, especially around twilight, and sometimes the data obtained is unusable by existing methods of analysis due to this source of noise. This places limitations on the usefulness of solar geolocation in conservation and monitoring efforts.
                  
                
                
                  All existing methods of analysis are dependent on twilights being identifiable or faithfully recorded. Instead, the method introduced here depends on the overall pattern of day and night to calculate the likelihoods for a Hidden Markov Model, where the hidden states are geographic locations. We call this a “twilight‐free” method of light‐based geolocation.
                
                
                  This method quickly estimates locations from otherwise unusable noisy light data. We use examples to show that the method produces tracks that are comparable in accuracy and precision to other geolocation methods. Furthermore, efficiency and replicability of estimated paths are improved because the user does not have to subjectively identify twilights. Other data sources, such as sea surface temperature and land or sea masks are easily incorporated, further improving location estimates and processing speed.
                
                
                  
                    The twilight‐free method offers new opportunities to researchers interested in the movements of animals that routinely have obscured sensors, or to analyse previously unusable noisy light data. It offers a fast, efficient, and replicable method for analysing tag data without the need for time‐consuming pre‐ or post‐processing. By increasing the yield of usable data from
                    GLS
                    tagging studies, researchers can more efficiently quantify where animals are going and when, and monitor changes in habitat. This is of fundamental importance to management and conservation efforts.},

                    The advent of miniaturized biologging devices has provided ecologists with unprecedented opportunities to record animal movement across scales, and led to the collection of ever‐increasing quantities of tracking data. In parallel, sophisticated tools have been developed to process, visualize and analyse tracking data; however, many of these tools have proliferated in isolation, making it challenging for users to select the most appropriate method for the question in hand. Indeed, within the
                    r
                    software alone, we listed 58 packages created to deal with tracking data or ‘tracking packages’.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Here, we reviewed and described each tracking package based on a workflow centred around tracking data (i.e. spatio‐temporal locations (
                    x
                    ,
                    y
                    ,
                    t
                    )), broken down into three stages: pre‐processing, post‐processing and analysis, the latter consisting of data visualization, track description, path reconstruction, behavioural pattern identification, space use characterization, trajectory simulation and others.
                  
                
                
                  Supporting documentation is key to render a package accessible for users. Based on a user survey, we reviewed the quality of packages' documentation and identified 11 packages with good or excellent documentation.
                
                
                  
                    Links between packages were assessed through a network graph analysis. Although a large group of packages showed some degree of connectivity (either depending on functions or suggesting the use of another tracking package), one third of the packages worked in isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the
                    r
                    movement‐ecology programming community.
                  
                
                
                  Finally, we provide recommendations for users when choosing packages, and for developers to maximize the usefulness of their contribution and strengthen the links within the programming community.},
